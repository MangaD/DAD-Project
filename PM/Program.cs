         * at an URL on port 10000 for the PuppetMaster to request the creation of a process.
         * For simplicity, we assume that the PuppetMaster knows the URLs of the entire set
         * of available PCSs. This information can be provided, for instance, via
         * configuration file or command line.
         * 
         * Note: A better idea is to just assume there is a PCS, listening on port 10000,
         * on the URL of the server or client that we're trying to launch. Therefore,
         * everytime we attempt to launch a server or client, we add the corresponding
         * PCS to this list (if it is not here already).
